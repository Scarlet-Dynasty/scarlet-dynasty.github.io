# Features

## Color Blind Friendly

We have used pixelated version of **ColorADD Social** icons on our card textures to make the colors easily identifiable while playing ❤

# UNO Rules

- We have based the rules in the most authentic way possible according to the official rules of UNO *Classic*. Click below to checkout the card game rules.
    - **[OFFICIAL UNO RULES](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/uno/game-rules.php)**
<br>

- **Some mechanics specific to our world:**
    - you only get 30 seconds to make a move per turn.
    - failing to make a move in time will cause you to automatically draw +1 random card.
    - If you played a wild or draw 4 card and failed to pick a color in time a random color will be picked for you. 
<br>

> **Tip:** play all your special cards (+2, +4, reverse, skip, wild) as soon as possible because they cost more points if someone plays all their cards before you. Similarly, try to play all bigger number cards first.
