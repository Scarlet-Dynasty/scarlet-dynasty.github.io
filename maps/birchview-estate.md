Have you ever wanted to start your survival world, but didn't want the hassle with creating your starter base and spend hours upon hours of planning and organizing?

Ever aspired to be a lord/lady without having to work that hard for it?

# Features

You get a beautiful big house to start in. Comes with a horse stable with space for two, a lovely little pond to fish in, a little sawmill, a big wheat field and a wagon to go on large travels (or so you can imagine at least).<br>
*You might also find a sword in a stone somewhere.*

You get all the essential crafting stations to start your journey as well as the horse, Olivia! But you still have to work to get a proper start.

It's perfectly safe inside, but once you go outside, you might find that you'd have to defend your estate and secure the perimeter. Expand and grow your estate to your liking.<br>
Who knows - maybe you'll be the major of a town someday if you dedicate yourself to expanding!
