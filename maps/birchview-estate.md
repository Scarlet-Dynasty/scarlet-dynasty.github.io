Have you ever wanted to start your survival world, but didn't want the hassle with creating your starter base and spend hours upon hours of planning and organizing? 

Ever wished that you could just start with something pre-built so you can focus on getting started with the exciting stuff right away? 

Ever aspired to be a lord/lady without having to work that hard for it?

Here's your chance! Scarlet Dynasty offers you just that with Birchview Estate!
You get a beautiful big house to start in. Comes with a horse stable with space for two, a lovely little pond to fish in, a little sawmill, a big wheat field and a wagon to go on large travels (or so you can imagine at least). You might also find a sword in a stone somewhere :)

You get all the essential crafting stations to start your journey as well as the horse, Olivia! But you still have to work to get a proper start.
