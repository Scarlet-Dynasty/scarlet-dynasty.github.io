# About Us

We are a team of skilled developers & designers working together to create the next revolutionary thing to the Minecraft community. Our standard is set high, so expect high-quality content that either meshes well with the vanilla game or it is so well put together that it feels like a completely different game!

Scarlet Dynasty started with a passion for developing and designing in different aspects of the game. With great visions, we see opportunities where other people might see obstacles. Our standard is set high, so in that sense, we would rather push a deadline to ensure good content - Quality over quantity!

We are aiming high, but we still remain realistic about things. We work with the limitations (and limitless options) that we have been given, and we delve into the heart of what is possible for developers and designers to do!

Most of us come from another place where we met and bonded through playing an SMP together, there were highs and lows, but as most of us went our separate ways, we kept in touch, doing our own things here and there along the way - and we still do! Throughout time, we have all developed our own unique skill sets, some have become expert command geniuses, add-on makers, coders, designers and other creative and technical masterminds.
Now here we are, we came together again and started doing things together again, and we will continue to do so, for you, for us, for everyone as a whole!
